<h1>Corral's Vector Calculus</h1>

<p>
Here you can download <a href="calc3book.pdf">Corral's Vector Calculus</a>. 
It is a modified version of <a href="hhttp://mecmath.net/">Vector Calculus</a> written by Michael Corral and released under <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html">GNU Free Documentation License</a>.
I was making changes while teaching a calculus course at Penn State.
I do not plan to continue, unless I will have to teach the same class again.
</p>
<p>
I did not plan to publish this book myself, 
but was not able to contact Michael Corral.
Please let me know if you have a way to contact him.
