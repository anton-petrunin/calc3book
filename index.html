<h1>Corral's Vector Calculus</h1>

<p>
This is the homepage for a modified version of "Vector Calculus" by Michael Corral.
The modifications were made by Anton Petrunin while teaching a calculus course at Penn State, Fall 2016.
Both, the modified version and <a href="http://mecmath.net/">the original</a> are written under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html">GNU Free Documentation License</a>.
(Michael Corral has pledged to keep the book's contents the same, except for corrections of errors and typos.)
</p>
<p>
You can download the latest version of "Corral's Vector Calculus" here: <a href="calc3book.pdf">calc3book.pdf</a>. 
</p>
<p>
W hope this page will evolve into a hub for a community-developed book.
We invite everyone to participate; "Wikis" and "Issues" on GitHub should make it easy.  
You can also reach out via email (which is easy to find).
<p>
The source code can be obtained from <a href="https://github.com/anton-petrunin/calc3book">https://github.com/anton-petrunin/calc3book</a>.
