<h1>Corral's Vector Calculus</h1>

<p>
Tis site is the homepage for a modified vesion of "Vector Calculus" by Michael Corral.
The modifications were made by Anton Petrunin, while teaching a calculus course at Penn State, Fall 2016.
Both, the modified version and <a href="http://mecmath.net/">the original</a> are written under <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html">GNU Free Documentation License</a>.
(Michael Corral made a pledge to keep the book's contents the same modulo corrections of errors and typos.)
</p>
<p>
You can download the latest version of our "Corral's Vector Calculus" here: <a href="calc3book.pdf">calc3book.pdf</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Hopefully this page will become a home for a community developed book.
I invite everyone to participate, "Wikis" and "Issues" on GitHub should make it easy; you could also write me an email (which is easy to find).
</p>
<p>
The source could be obtained from  <a href="https://github.com/anton-petrunin/calc3book">https://github.com/anton-petrunin/calc3book</a>;
if you install <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29"> Git</a>, the following command will create a local copy of the source code for you.
